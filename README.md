# ParadOEIS

This is a project birthed from my love of both numbers and the sequences of them

[The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integers](https://oeis.org/) hosts a plethora of sequences that I've enjoyed and studied over many years and having dabbled in several [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) equations I finally want to create a new project that generates some of these wonderful sequences as well as tries to optimize their generation

The name of this project "ParadOEIS" is a portmanteau of my long-lasting moniker "Parad0x13" and of course "OEIS". I hope to have lots of fun programming and learning new mathematical concepts and improving my own skills. Honestly? I should have started this long ago!

I'm not sure exactly how many terms will be generated but as I'm sure many sequences will be either too fast or too slow to generate N terms

I'll try not to use any language specific optimizations on the calculations and stick as closely to pure mathematics as I can
However I'm sure I won't be able to strictly adhere to that

## Shoutout to these projects and resources that aid in this project
