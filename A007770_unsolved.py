# [NOTE] This entry is unsolved due to me not understanding how to formally generate the repeating patterns
# These are listed under https://oeis.org/A039943 and although I can manually find them I have
# no idea if I've found them all. I understand there are very few through OEIS but I would rather understand
# and then solve this more formally. Until then I'm going to keep this one open but unsolved
